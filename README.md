When I first started working on my weight loss tracking app, I was really excited but also pretty nervous. I called it HealthHelper, and the main idea was to make something simple that could help people like me track their weight and stay motivated. At first, I just wanted it to do basic stuff like saving weight entries and showing progress, but as I kept working, I got all these new ideas - like adding encouraging messages and pretty charts to make it more fun to use.

I ran into lots of problems along the way that I didn't expect. The charts were especially tricky because I wanted them to show the truth but not make people feel bad if their weight went up sometimes. It took me forever to figure out how to make the app work even when people said no to notifications. And I'll never forget the first time my app crashed because I forgot to handle a skipped day - that was a big lesson in testing everything!

Looking back, I'm most proud that I made something real that actually works. My favorite part is how the app celebrates when someone hits their goals - those little messages took me ages to get right, but now they make me smile every time. This project taught me that making apps isn't just about typing code, but about thinking how real people will use what you build. I made so many mistakes, but each one helped me learn, and now I can't wait to make my next app even better!
